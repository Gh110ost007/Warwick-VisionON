# README and VIDEO

VisionON! is a digital art gallery platform designed to empower pixel artists and streamline the curation process through a robust role-based system. The application supports two distinct user classes: superusers and pixel artists. During registration, new users must verify their email addresses via a verification link sent using Flask-Mail, ensuring that only genuine accounts are activated. Once registered, users can authenticate using either their email or username along with their password, reset forgotten passwords through their email, and update their profile details—including their email and password—with appropriate verification steps.

Pixel artists can upload 64×64 pixel artworks, which are stored directly in the database along with metadata such as the artwork's name, pixel data, upload date, and a moderation status that can be unmoderated, pending, approved, or archived. Although pixel artists can archive their own submissions, only superusers have the authority to moderate artworks: they can assign display locations (e.g., DCSAtrium, MSB, Piazza), archive or unarchive artworks without altering the original data (while preserving vote counts), and reset votes for moderated artworks by providing a reason, which is logged with a timestamp. Additionally, pixel artists can upvote or downvote moderated artworks and view detailed information such as the moderation status and unique identifiers (barcode/QR code) for each piece.

For public users who do not log in, the gallery displays only approved artworks that have an assigned location. Extra features include the ability for pixel artists to upload a profile photo and for superusers to access a detailed log of significant transactions—such as artwork uploads, deletions, moderation actions, vote casting, and user logins/logouts—enhancing transparency and accountability throughout the system.
